If you are an IT Pro and have been holding off your Windows 10 upgrade until Microsoft released a compatible RSAT kit your wait is now over.

[True to their word](/windows-10-rsat-coming-this-month/), today Microsoft have released [Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45520) and you can grab it now over at the [Microsoft Download Centre](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45520).

Available in 32-bit and 64-bit packages (yes it seems some people are still using 32-bit systems), the download weighs in around 40MB so it won't be long before you are happily managing your remote servers from the latest Windows desktop client.

Oddly, there are a number of features that this release does not include:

- DHCP Tools
- IP Address Management (IPAM) Tools
- Network Policy Server Tools
- Routing and Remote Access Tools

So if you are looking to manage any of these roles or features, it's back to Remote Desktop or PowerShell for you.
