[Windows 10](http://www.microsoft.com/windows10) has been available for a couple of weeks now, but IT Pros are still missing a key component - an update to the Remote Server Administration Tools.

Without a compatible version, Windows 10 users are left in the cold when it comes to managing the roles and features installed on remote Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 servers.

You can get versions of RSAT for [Windows 7 SP1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=7887) and [Windows 8.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=39296) but these don't work on Windows 10, so if you are an early adopter it looks like you will need to wait a little longer and rely on Remote Desktop or another workstation to manage your servers remotely for a little longer.

I'm hoping it lands sooner rather than later.
