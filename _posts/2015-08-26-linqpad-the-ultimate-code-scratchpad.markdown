I've been a fan of [LINQPad](http://www.linqpad.net) for a few years now. If you are a .NET Developer and haven't heard about LINQPad, you have seriously been missing out.

[LINQPad](http://www.linqpad.net) is advertised as "The .NET ProgrammerÔÇÖs Playground" and it really lives up to this. It is the ultimate code scratchpad if you develop in C# (don't worry, F# and VB is supported too) and it can save you some serious development time.

Imagine the scenario... you need to test out some new code - maybe you want to play around with the new C# 6.0 features (you'll want [LINQPad 5](http://www.linqpad.net/Download.aspx#beta5) which is currently in [beta](http://www.linqpad.net/Download.aspx#beta5) for this) - so what do you do today? Fire up Visual Studio and create a new console app? Not now you've discovered LINQPad.

Instead, you open up LINQPad and start typing. Hit F5 and the output of your code is displayed below the editor - not in some separate DOS-style console after the application has been compiled. Want to visualise a complex object? No problem. Want to query a database with a few clicks? No problem.

You can throw so much at LINQPad and it just handles it all.

As much as I enjoy Visual Studio ([especially the newly released Visual Studio 2015](/the-best-new-feature-in-visual-studio-2015/)), LINQPad is simpler and quicker when it comes to testing something out or learning something new.

LINQPad is a free download and is always one of the first applications I stick on a new machine. While you can benefit a lot from the free version, [additional amazing functionality can be unlocked for a pocket-friendly price](http://www.linqpad.net/Purchase.aspx).

So next time you need to try out a snippet of C#, F# or VB code, [give LINQPad a try](http://www.linqpad.net/Download.aspx). You won't regret it.
